This page contains a lot of text and info, there‚Äôs a [TLDR;](https://www.notion.so/Plugdata-and-daisy-seed-mpr121-touch-sensor-41be6a24dc0b4dc4bdd2fffbe4763dee?pvs=21) if you want to just *quickly* see how to get Plugdata and the MPR121 sensor up and running.

## Synthux Synthmas 2023 Challenge

The bulk of this work was made building up to [Synthux academy‚Äôs Synthmas 2023 challenge](https://www.synthux.academy/events/synthmas-2023).

[2023 Synthmas Contest](https://www.synthux.academy/events/synthmas-2023)

**The challenge:** build an instrument / sound fx with a Daisy seed and a MPR121 touchcontroller.

I used the Simple Touch by Synthux but this was optional.

In short the **goal of Synthux** was to create a pool of examples from which the community can benefit.

**My goal**, even before the challenge was to start using Plugdata as a way to realize my project of building my concept Soundscpr, a musical, texture, sound-scaping device shaped like a landscape. 

I‚Äôve got  that ‚Äòend goal‚Äô Soundscpr in mind and have already built these: a noise box and a custom top on a ShieldXL (monome norns clone by Denki Oto).

![IMG20231101210418-01.jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/183357c7-1e01-4c65-a869-200d788b649c/ac9b342b-a382-4504-b874-f9eb06c30977/IMG20231101210418-01.jpeg)

This is a 3D sketch where I hope to land, it‚Äôs designed to fit on top of a Synthux Simple board.:

Overlay on the Synthux Simple PCB:

This Soundscpr would have three main parts; The rock (with a noisebox piezo function), The brain hill (reverb and filtering) and the H2O part containing a touch keypad.

One of the elements I wanted to use was the MPR121, so this challenge was an excellent stepping stone and an well timed opportunity to learn.

# My submission:

## Simple delay/ looper/ drone/ fx/ basic aeolean tuned synth/ soundscpr - Built with plugdata

### About my Plugdata Patch and instrument fx box:

The Plugdata patch I‚Äôve build contains:

![Simpletouch_delaydronefx_soundscpr_layout.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/183357c7-1e01-4c65-a869-200d788b649c/e8163d12-015e-4b7d-a6e9-fe1ca61336e9/Simpletouch_delaydronefx_soundscpr_layout.jpg)

- **Stereo audio input**
    - Left fader controls a dry signal that bypasses the delay
    - toggling the touch pads on top (the Tou-ch logo, pads 10 and 11) will send only the audio input to delay and trigger an LED
        - LED = red means recording only for the audio input,
            - (keypads have a separate feedback knob 4)
        - Turning it of allows to still keep listening to the live input via the left fader.
- S**tereo ping-pong delay**
    - **Knob 1: Time** up to 5000ms (left and right have a difference to create a moving stereo pinpong)
    - **Knob 2: Feedback** (up to almost infinite looping)
    - **Knob 3: Delay volume**
- **Touch keypad**
    - **with an aeolean scale** mapped to **knob 5**
        - note this isn‚Äôt locked, the knob will simply go from 0 to 440hz.
            - via simple calculations sending the osc~ through frequency to midi, adding notes, then back to frequency (using mtof and ftom blocks)
    - **Pads 3 - 9** are basic osc~ with a quick attack and slower release
    - **Switch 1 and 2**: droning osc (with noise) to the pitch of knob 5
        - Stop or add **noise** on top of the drones with **pads 0 and 2**
        
        | Pad | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | switch 1 | switch 2 |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | Semitones | +0 | +1 | +3 | +5 | +6 | +8 | - 12 | - 24 |

What follows beneath this is my documentation, which grew into a full blown guide on how every step went. There‚Äôs a short TLDR; (Too long, didn't read) here, if you‚Äôre not as noob as me ;-)

## TLDR;

Getting plugdata and MPR121 up and running

- Install Plugdata
- Choose the compile option in the menu
- Download the toolchain
- Edit `plugdata\Toolchain\usr\bin\Heavy\json2daisy\resources\component_defs.json`
    - delete the part referring to the pins in the ‚Äúmap_init‚Äù **line 558**, leave the line ‚Äúpin‚Äù as is:
    - delete: `{name}_config.scl = som.GetPin({pin_scl});\n    {name}_config.sda = som.GetPin({pin_sda});\n`
- Create a custom json file with all the components connected to the Daisy ([download below](https://www.notion.so/Plugdata-and-daisy-seed-mpr121-touch-sensor-41be6a24dc0b4dc4bdd2fffbe4763dee?pvs=21))
- Start patching
    - Use this block in the patch `r mpr121_driver_ch0 @hv_param`
    - to refer to touch pads 0 - 11 change `_ch0` , `_ch‚Ä¶` up to `_ch11`
    - To use the knobs and faders and switch use the names you‚Äôve added in the custom json file
        - e.g. `r toggle1left @hv_param` or `r knob1@hv_param`
- Go to the compiler menu and pick the right options and flash!
    - note I‚Äôm using a Custom Linker, but you should check first if the small, big or huge modes work for you, more [on the use of memory below](https://www.notion.so/Plugdata-and-daisy-seed-mpr121-touch-sensor-41be6a24dc0b4dc4bdd2fffbe4763dee?pvs=21).

# Intro - about this page and my learning process

<aside>
üí° **These are my notes on getting the touch sensor mpr121 talking to Daisy seed through Plugdata**

</aside>

I had some hurdles getting daisy to speak to custom knobs and the touch sensor.

I‚Äôm a newcomer to Plugdata, coding and daisy - though I‚Äôve been fumbling with Arduino for some years, I mostly just copy paste until it works. Fake it ‚Äòtill you make it! üîçüìãüòÖ

## SynthUX Academy - Simple Touch

Specifically the code here is ready for Simple Touch Synth Kit, but can be adapted to fit your own custom setup going from Plugdata to Daisy. Specifically the documentation here is intended to help me remember the workflow in the future. 

[Simple Touch Synth Kit](https://www.synthux.academy/shop/touch-kit)

### Custom json for addressing knobs and touchpads

To use the touchpads via Plugdata you‚Äôll need a description of your board and how the pins are connected. This custom json file is discussed below. 

Note there's also a guide over on the daisy forum. It goes over the same basics of setting up a custom json. Though without addressing the mpr121 part specifically.

https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/quick-guide-on-setting-up-a-custom-json-file-for-pd2dsy-oopsy/4021

### Memory allocations and regions for e.g. using delayread

Specifically I started out with wanting to experiment with **delays**, and the `delread` block quickly fills up the memory of the Daisy when you want longer delays than 1 or 2 seconds. That‚Äôs why I ended up using a custom linker to make us of makes use of SDRAM. Delays make use of this larger available memory. Though I‚Äôve yet to learn more about how memory allocation actually flows, this seems like a good thing to know.

On the bottom of this page I‚Äôve got some extra info on where to find more on using these modes and the way the bootloader works.

Open each section to follow my findings and how I got the mpr121 to work in plugdata

## About visually / modular programming

If you don‚Äôt know Pure Data, Plugdata, Pd, flavours, modular, Visual programming. What are these? Read this

<aside>
üí° If you now what Plugdata is and how it‚Äôs different from Pure Data > skip this part, I‚Äôve written this with noobs like myself in mind.

</aside>

- Pure Data goes back many years and was made as a tool to help artists create (interactive) sound. It uses a visual blocks structure, comparable to e.g. Scratch, a tool used to teach (kids) programming, you link pieces of code together where each block has a specific function in the whole.
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/183357c7-1e01-4c65-a869-200d788b649c/c1f0b436-9793-4592-ab78-be86734b53b2/Untitled.png)
    
    - Pure Data - ‚Äúflavours‚Äù
        
        > **Pure Data**¬†(or just "Pd") is an open source visual programming language for multimedia. Pure Data is developed by Miller Puckette since 1996 and you can find it on¬†[his official website](https://msp.ucsd.edu/)¬†along with the official documentation and other related resources. This is the official "Pd" or "main distribution" and it is also known as "Pd Vanilla", but there are other forks or "flavours".
        > 
        
        source: intro on [puredata.info](http://puredata.info) 
        
- Plugdata is a flavour that builds upon the vanilla Pure Data, but adds a more user friendly interface, implements the tools we can use to program the Daisy microcontroller, makes use of more visual elements, can become a VST plugin, ‚Ä¶
    - Plugdata
        
        > plugdata is a free/open-source visual programming environment based on pure-data. It is available for a wide range of operating systems, and can be used both as a standalone app, or as a VST3, LV2, CLAP or AU plugin.
        > 
        
        > plugdata allows you to create and manipulate audio systems using visual elements, rather than writing code. Think of it as building with virtual blocks ‚Äì simply connect them together to design your unique audio setups. It's a user-friendly and intuitive way to experiment with audio and programming.

        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/183357c7-1e01-4c65-a869-200d788b649c/4f81c328-3752-408d-bb06-dd6e33731895/Untitled.png)
        

### The modular approach

- There are many tools out there that use this approach to programming or building electronic stuff, be it analog or digital. In 3D software like e.g. Blender they‚Äôre called nodes, Touchdesigner and [Cables.gl](http://Cables.gl) are both examples of tools that heavily rely on the approach of connecting blocks with virtual cables.
- You could go far with this analogy as all things are a whole of parts, yet for sake of this document let‚Äôs just keep the connecting of different parts as the main concept.
- Coming from the music world you might be familiar with modular Eurorack synths. Maybe you‚Äôve even used synths or kits that use Daisy. Or maybe you‚Äôve seen the virtual eurorack systems like VCV rack or Cherry Audio Voltage Modular and many others ([see some listed in this article on attackmagazine.](https://www.attackmagazine.com/reviews/the-best/ten-of-the-best-modular-software/) )
    - VCV a virtual cable spaghetti maker:
    
    https://youtu.be/NPErDUlwSlg?list=PL7NZKetd80yrCyyQ2-1J8fad420gL8MAf
    
- Seeing you‚Äôve stumbled upon this page, you‚Äôre probably already interested or knowledgeable on the concept of using code and libraries. I have been tinkering with Arduino microcontrollers before and most code I‚Äôve used relied heavily on the work of others, not only the builders of the hardware and it‚Äôs software, but also people who‚Äôve made pieces of code often called libraries that you refer to in your own piece of code. Or sometimes it‚Äôs just pieces you could copy paste at the bottom etc. ‚Ä¶
    - So you can use links or refer to these pre-made pieces of functions and tools inside your own code that get compiled or run in the background.
        - E.g. case in point of this page referring to Daisy seed and the mpr121: you link to the mpr121 touch sensor, and in pure data all you need to do is refer to the touch points, without actually knowing how it works.
        - The necessary code to talk to the sensor, the code to read the sensor, and the implementation into plugdata is all being done through various tools, libraries.
        - As an end user we can just put a block that says ‚Äúknob1‚Äù, etc.
    - Pure Data can be seen as a similar thing of being a modular programming approach you write names of functions or tools; e.g. an oscillator, you don‚Äôt know how the oscillator is itself in turn made of smaller components. You just put a block that says give me an oscillator with the frequency 440.
        - We don‚Äôt always have to know how to make paint, brushes and canvas to be a proficient painter

### Let‚Äôs get started, full length explanations on getting MPR121 working;

# **Install Plugdata**

- download plugdata from [plugdata.org](https://plugdata.org/download.html) see the install instructions there as well
- After installing the software you need to install the toolchain
    - Install the toolchain the first time from plugdata by going to ‚Äúcompile‚Äù in the menu
    - upon clicking that menu item you should be prompted to first install this toolchain, this takes a while nut is a one time need, later you‚Äôll need to find the installed folder to edit a file (see below)

---

# **Workflow: from plugdata to Daisy**

To **get code from plugdata into daisy** we need to understand the workflow

<aside>
üí° Not all existing patches work as is; they get converted; Many of the fancy visual stuff is useless for Daisy, many patches rely on stuff that isn‚Äôt supported, and Daisy also has limited CPU power compared to a computer.

</aside>

- Patches get converted from pure data to C/C++ code
- The conversion is done by hvcc https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc
- some pd stuff is not supported, there is a [list with all (un)supported items](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc/blob/develop/docs/09.supported_vanilla_objects.md)
- e.g. Plug Data ‚Äúelse‚Äù is not (yet) able to convert anything using this, library
- plugdata makes it ‚Äòeasy‚Äô when you use ‚Äòcompiled mode‚Äô by showing a warning what is or isn‚Äôt supported
- Next to the need to use your own custom json, there‚Äôs a predefined json file. It‚Äôs a similar looking file, but is sort of the ‚Äòmother‚Äô and contains the code that your custom json board files use as a sort of template in the compiling process.
    - These predefined json files are part of the toolchain and are ‚Äòhard‚Äô to find. Normally you wouldn‚Äôt need to edit these, but below I explain further what to edit for the mpr121.

---

# **To compile we need a custom json file**

- To address knobs or buttons etc. connected to daisy pins we define a list in a custom json file;
- This json file needs to be selected in the compile window under target board
- It seems I had to reselect the json file in previous versions when I saved changes in the file each time again before compiling for Plugdata to see these changes. So I now have the custom to reselect it each time I‚Äôve changed something inside the json. Newer versions fixed this, once selected it keeps using the last one.
- The custom json file will be used in the compile screen where we select it as our custom board under ‚ÄúTarget board‚Äù.
- more on the use of the patch size options below this document: [Extra info on using different memory options](https://www.notion.so/Extra-info-on-using-different-memory-options-dd221e0823cd4e589fb10dc6ee43e682?pvs=21)

# **Edit a part of the toolchain json** components definition file

To get a working mpr121 **edit a part of the toolchain json** components definition file / might get fixed

- This is not ‚Äònormal‚Äô and is supposed to work without the edit;
- this bug has been reported: **[Bug: mpr121 pin setup incorrect](https://github.com/electro-smith/json2daisy/issues/18)**

https://github.com/electro-smith/json2daisy/issues/18

- currently the file in question is causing an error referring to wrong pins
    - mpr121 touch sensor is supported, however seems to give a pin error:
    - `Error c2daisy: 'pin_scl‚Äô`
- We need to edit the file that contains the mpr121 code and is located in the installed toolchain:
    - edit code in the json file `component_defs.json`
    - on my windows machine it‚Äôs here: `C:\Users\gebruiker\Documents\plugdata\Toolchain\usr\bin\Heavy\json2daisy\resources\component_defs.json`
- Change the first line `‚Äúmap_init‚Äù`:
    - Note I‚Äôve added a few extra lines to easily see where it‚Äôs located

```json
Original code:
--------------
"Mpr121": {
		"map_init": "daisy::Mpr121I2CTransport::Config {name}_config;\n    {name}_config.periph = {periph};\n    {name}_config.speed = {speed};\n    {name}_config.scl = som.GetPin({pin_scl});\n    {name}_config.sda = som.GetPin({pin_sda});\n    {name}_config.dev_addr = {address};\n    daisy::Mpr121I2C::Config {name}_main_conf;\n    {name}_main_conf.transport_config = {name}_config;\n    {name}_main_conf.touch_threshold = {touch_threshold};\n    {name}_main_conf.release_threshold = {release_threshold};\n    {name}.Init({name}_main_conf);",
		"typename": "daisy::Mpr121I2C",
		"direction": "in",
		"pin": "scl,sda",
```

delete the part referring to the pins in the ‚Äúmap_init‚Äù **line 558**, leave the line ‚Äúpin‚Äù as is:

delete: `{name}_config.scl = som.GetPin({pin_scl});\n    {name}_config.sda = som.GetPin({pin_sda});\n`    

```json
Altered code:
-------------
"Mpr121": {
		"map_init": "daisy::Mpr121I2CTransport::Config {name}_config;\n    {name}_config.periph = {periph};\n    {name}_config.speed = {speed};\n     {name}_config.dev_addr = {address};\n    daisy::Mpr121I2C::Config {name}_main_conf;\n    {name}_main_conf.transport_config = {name}_config;\n    {name}_main_conf.touch_threshold = {touch_threshold};\n    {name}_main_conf.release_threshold = {release_threshold};\n    {name}.Init({name}_main_conf);",
		"typename": "daisy::Mpr121I2C",
		"direction": "in",
		"pin": "scl,sda",
```

# json for the ‚Äúcustom‚Äù daisy board

This was made to fit the Daisy seed into a Simple Synthux touch board, this can be altered to fit other setups or the larger simple board

This code is the basics:

```json
{
    "name": "soundscprDaisy",
    "som": "seed",
    "audio": {
      "channels": 2
    },

    "parents": {
      "mpr121_driver": {
        "component": "Mpr121"
        }
    }

}
```

The full code below wasn‚Äôt working at first because of the use of **Caps in the custom component name**. I was using `faderLeft` in the json file, which prompted this error when compiling in Plugdata: `Error c2daisy: Unknown parameter "faderLeft‚Äù`

Don‚Äôt use caps in the names. JUST DON‚ÄôT üòÜ

# Pins **table overview** for Simple Touch

I‚Äôm still often confused by the pin numbering used to program daisy. So I‚Äôve made a table with an overview.

# Example patch 1 (minimal) in Plugdata

- Use this block in the patch `r mpr121_driver_ch0 @hv_param`
- to refer to touch pads 0 - 11 change `_ch0` , `_ch‚Ä¶` up to `_ch11`
- The output of this block is a 0 or 1 state. So while being touched it sends a 1
- Copy-paste this code into a new plugdata patch

## Smoothing and performance practices:

And also, as I‚Äôve learned from ‚Äòdreamer‚Äô on the Daisy discord, it‚Äôs good practice to avoid using graphical elements like sliders etc, because those are ignored when converted, while building a patch they can be helpful in testing code before uploading, but they add bulk to the code wich can make your files unnecessarily big. Rather make use of `trigger float bang symbol list anything pointer` or the shorthand `t f b s l a p` 

Also it‚Äôs good practice to keep as much as you can in the Signal ~ domain.

And smoothing are easing down the input from sensors or knobs can be beneficial for performance.

Here‚Äôs a patch with some fading, less harsh then the sudden on/off sounds of the example above. In example 2 below there‚Äôs the same tactics for using knobs.

# Example patch 2 (all options of Simple Touch)

Larger patch with examples of how to use all Simple Touch options: faders, knobs, switches and touchpads.

I‚Äôm actively working on this patch and have submitted it to [Synthux‚Äôs Synthmas challenge](https://www.synthux.academy/events/synthmas-2023) ( january 2024) so it gets added to the pool of examples. 

- [x]  Todo: copy this documentation into a github repo, and post link here.
- [ ]  Edit formatting on Github
- [ ]  Reupload readme to Github

The delay in this patch is a slightly altered version of the file petal_test.pd found the pd2dsy examples on Github:

[](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy/blob/master/examples/PdFiles/petal_test.pd)

- The sound you input in adc~ is run into a delay effect with a max buffer of 5 seconds.
- Knobs 1, 2, 3: Delay time, delay feedback, delay volume
- The two switches turn on and off two osc~ at a steady 110 and 220 hz.
- Touchpads 4, 6 also trigger an osc~ but their pitch is controlled by knob 0 and 5, going from 0 to 440 hz.
- Knob 4 sends the touchpad sounds into the delay feedback loop. When you turn the feedback back down you can play the pads without those getting send into the delay.
- Fader left controls the volume of the two switches
- Fader right controls the volume of the two touchpads
- Using the feeback knobs to maximum will create an endless looper.
- In this delay, changing the delay time will also be recorded into the feedback loop, effectively changing pitch.

# Extra info on using different memory options

The Daisy has a few options for uploading your compiled patch. 

More info on the subjects ram,  rom SDRAM, size, speed, ‚Ä¶ : 

[GitHub - electro-smith/pd2dsy: Utility for converting Pure Data (Vanilla) patches to Daisy projects.](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#--ram)

And this site 

[libDaisy: Getting Started - External SDRAM](https://electro-smith.github.io/libDaisy/md_doc_2md_2__a6___getting-_started-_external-_s_d_r_a_m.html)

To be able to use this larger memory I‚Äôm using the custom linker **[sram_linker_sdram.lds](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy/blob/master/util/sram_linker_sdram.lds)** found at the pd2dsy Github: 

[](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy/tree/master/util)

I saved the file on my computer and in the compile window choose this file with option ‚Äòcustom linker‚Äô under ‚Äò**Patch size**‚Äô 

- Also pick the corresponding ‚Äò**App type**‚Äô option below that, I didn‚Äôt see it at first that I could scroll down !
