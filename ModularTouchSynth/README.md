# Touchpad Modular Synth
#### by Sam Knight
Patchable synth using Simple Synth Touch Kit. Edit your instrument and play it at the same time! Featuring 3 oscillators, a chorus, delay and many other changable parameters.


## Using the Synth
Before editing, I like to have a sequence going so I can hear the changes in real time (See sequencing...). Once you have the sequence you can go into edit mode and follow the "Pad Modules" and "Knob Parameters for Each Module" table to change what you'd like. The synth features a chorus and delay, and typical modular synth parameters that you're free to change. In patch mode, you are able to patch the 3 oscillators into eachother. Once patched, you can then change the FM amount for the carrier oscillators and choose what level of FM you'd like. You can unpatch at anytime by hitting pad 11 (except when you're in sequence mode).
<br><br> *Tip:* When patching oscillators for FM synthesis, you'll have the best results with having the carrier oscillator be a sin wave.

# Modes
### Play Mode: 
In play mode, you can play pads 3-9. It is a C major scale with C starting on pad 3, and ending on B with pad 9. You can also use the slider on the left to transpose up, or down an octave.
### Sequence Mode:
In sequence mode, you can hit any note to add it to the sequence. The max notes allowed is 16. You can also hit pad 11 to put in a rest. The sequence will also remember which octave you pick. Once you go out of sequence mode, you will hit the sequence. You can hit pad 10 at anytime to clear the sequence.
### Edit Mode:
In edit mode, each pad turns into the modules listed below. When you hit the pad, each knob then becomes mappable with that modules given parameters as listed in "Knob Parameters for Each Module."
### Patch Mode:
Patch mode is where you can patch the 3 oscillators into eachother. The oscillators are just the first 3 pads (0, 1, 2). After patching, you can unpatch at anytime with pad 11 (except when in sequence mode).
